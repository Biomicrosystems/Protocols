# Protocols
Protocol files and support files

Each folder contains the information related to one protocol. Please read carefully the topic of the protocol you need to find it easier. The following distribution and ordering has been placed to easy yhe search. Some protocols can be related to more than one category.

- Microfluidics
- Nanocomposites and Nanostructuration
- Sensors
- Measurement Techniques
- Chemical and Physical Processes
- Electronics
- Programming and SW development

Notes

a) Each protocol has been named accordingly to a number; e.g. P001, corresponds to Protocol # 001

b) Support files of that same Protocol will be named as P001s1, meaning the first support file for Protocol 001.
